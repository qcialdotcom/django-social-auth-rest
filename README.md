## What This Does

**Currently supported providers:** Google, GitHub
**More providers are coming soon.**

## Features

- Sign in with socail accounts (like google, github) - get back JWT access and refresh tokens
- Link or unlink social accounts from an existing user profile
- See which providers a user has connected
- CSRF protection via signed OAuth state tokens
- Rate limiting on all auth endpoints
- Optional support for soft-deleted user accounts
- Signals you can hook into for things like welcome emails or analytics
